# Assembly And Formal Verification

Welcome to the Assembly and Formal Verification repository! This project explores low-level Ethereum programming languages Huff and Yul, demonstrating their use in smart contract development.
Overview
This repository contains multiple projects focused on assembly-level programming in the Ethereum ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on:

## Huff: A low-level programming language designed for writing highly optimized EVM code
## Yul: An intermediate language that can compile to EVM bytecode

## What is Huff?
Huff is an optimized low-level programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Key features include:

Direct bytecode manipulation
Macro system for code reusability
Stack-oriented programming model
Gas optimization capabilities
Built-in function dispatcher generation

## What is Yul?
Yul is an intermediate programming language designed by the Ethereum Foundation. It offers:

Platform independence (can target EVM 1.0, EVM 1.5, and eWASM)
Human readability while maintaining low-level control
Integration with Solidity
Built-in optimization facilities
Support for both high and low-level programming patterns
